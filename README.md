Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive. You'll have a UCI HAR Dataset folder.
Put courseproject.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
Run source("courseproject.R"), then it will generate a new file tiny_dataset.txt in your working directory.
